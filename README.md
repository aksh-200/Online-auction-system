Document Purpose:


Project Background:

There is no computerized system for auctioning valuable products. Currently, the seller goes to nearest auctioning house or sell the product directly without auctioning online or offline, in both online and offline selling of product there are chances of bargaining for price by buyer. There are chances of frauds in case of selling valuable products online for both buyer and seller. Seller can only fix a price for selling and in some cases, buyers tends to bargain for the product. There is no way for buyer to check where the product is genuine or stolen. No facility is present for both buyers and sellers to detect chances of fraud during buying or selling.

Aim & Objectives:

The main objective of this project is building a website which will help buyers and sellers 	to participate in auction. Here if suppose some seller or buyer want to use this facility and 	learn how is it possible and how they can use Online Auction System to buy or sell the 	products, they must have knowledge of computer then they can directly register in the site 	and sell or buy the products online.

Constraints



The choice of the database to use should be considered carefully, since there will be a lot of data traffic and the large amounts of data will also judge the database. A good database will yield speed querying of data.

The browser used should support HTML5 to satisfy user experience.

The device should be enabled with internet




Outcomes


Outcomes:
Price Discovery:

Online auctions facilitate price discovery by allowing buyers to bid based on their perceived value of an item. The final winning bid reflects the market's assessment of the item's worth.
Market Reach:

Online auctions provide a broader market reach, allowing sellers to connect with a global audience. This can lead to increased competition and potentially higher prices for items.
Efficiency:

Compared to traditional auctions, online auctions can be more efficient. They reduce the time and geographical constraints associated with physical auctions.
Data and Analytics:

Online auctions generate a wealth of data that can be analyzed to understand buyer behavior, market trends, and the performance of different items. This information can be valuable for sellers and the auction platform.
Dynamic Pricing:

Prices in online auctions can be dynamic, adjusting in real-time based on bidding activity. This allows for a more flexible pricing model compared to fixed-price sales.
Diversity of Items:

Online auctions can accommodate a wide range of items, from rare collectibles to everyday goods. This diversity attracts a broad audience with varied interests.
Competitive Bidding:

The competitive nature of online auctions can result in higher prices for sellers. Bidders compete with each other, driving the final bid closer to the true market value of the item.




Purpose System


The proposed computerized "U Auction" site has made auction process simple. The only
5 pre-condition is that the user must register and authenticate before he/she can take part in the bidding process. The system uses HTTP forms authentication which creates a session cookie for any signed in user. Through out the span of the session the cookie remains valid until the user logs out.

An auction house needs to have products to auction, so in the proposed system this is done using product registration module. The module is open to user who is registered sellers and they need to authenticate before they register any product. The system controls the closing date by adding 14 days to the submitting date there by restricting the bidding process to go on indefinitely.

Another important module in the proposed project is the "Bidding module ". Here one can see the details of any particular product and also the bidding history. The user can bid on that item by entering any amount greater than or equal to the incremental bid amount. Here also system checks to see whether the user has his credential verified otherwise he/she will be directed to the login/registration page.

The last but the least module is the "Web Administration" module. The module is only open to the web administrator due to security reasons. In this module the administrator can add product categories; this is to avoid rampant creation of categories. The 2nd thing is the option to edit any given product. This will be necessary when some of the details of the product need to be edited for one reason or other. The 3rd and last the closed bid manager where the administrator notifies both the seller and buyer the need to complete the transaction.

There is another module which runs more or less like background process. The function of the module is to close bid of those products whose closing date is less than the current date. The process is automatic and hidden from the web users.
